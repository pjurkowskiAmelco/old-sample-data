The data directory contains a creation message and a pricing message for a number of events on key sports. These are intended to provide data for local test environments.

The sample directory contains example messages for particular workflows during the lifecycle of an event.


Scripts:

replay-msg.sh - this is used to replay a betsync-in message, using the betsync-in replay tool (https://git.amelco.co.uk/projects/TOOL/repos/betsync-in-replay/browse)

replay-all.sh - this script is used to replay the messages for all the test events. This is intended to be used to create a small number of events in a local test environment
